  algorithm which manages a deck of digital flash cards.

  A deck file 'minn.deck' is created in the current directory with the 'create'
  subcommand. An alternate location for the deck file to be created or managed
  with othere subcommands can be specified with the --deck option before the
  subcommand.

  Further help for each subcommand is given by the 'help' subcommand.

  -h, --help  Prints help message.
  --version   Prints version.
  -d, --deck=<filepath>
              Specifies path of deck database to operate upon.
  -b, --max-relearn-backlog=<number>
	      Limits how far back in the backlog the current card can be.
